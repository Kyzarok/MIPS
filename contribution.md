Contribution to the group
=========================

Group name : Mr Mipsseeks

For each row, assign integers which add up to 7, which
reflects a group consensus of how much you think members
contributes. If they don't add up to 7, they will be normalised
to integers that sum to 7.

Please note that the impact of this on individual marks
is tiny compared to how well the group did. This is about
trying to think about strengths/weaknesses and thinking
critically 

If you wish, feel free to add other rows, as long as they
are:
- meaningful
- don't overlap
- the number of rows is prime and <= 17.

For those in pairs, delete the third column.
